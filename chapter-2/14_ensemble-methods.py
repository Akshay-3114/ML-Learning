# To overcome the downside of the overfitting in decision trees, we use ensemble methods

# Ensembles are methods that combine multiple machine learning models to create
# more powerful models.

# There are two ensemble models that have proven to be effective on a 
# wide range of datasets for classification and regression, both of which 
# use decision trees as their building blocks: random forests and gradient boosted decision trees.
